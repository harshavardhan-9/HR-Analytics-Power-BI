- Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI for analysis.


# Data Exploration and Analysis (DAX):
-Created measures and calculated columns using DAX (e.g., COUNT, SUM) for KPIs and metrics.
- Used DAX to explore patterns and relationships in employee data.
- Enabled deeper insight into attrition causes, departmental trends, and role-specific behavior.

# Power BI Dashboard Visualization:
- Designed a clear, interactive dashboard layout with title, filters, and slicers.
